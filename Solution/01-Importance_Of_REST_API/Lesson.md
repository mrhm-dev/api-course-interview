## What is REST API?

This term “REST” was first defined by Roy Fielding in 2000. It stands for Representational State Transfer(REST). Actually, REST is an architectural model and design for server network applications. The most common application of REST is the World Wide Web itself, which used REST as a basis for HTTP 1.1 development.

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. Representational state transfer (REST), which is used by browsers, can be thought of as the language of the Internet.
