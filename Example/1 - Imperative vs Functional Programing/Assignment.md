# Assignment - Imperative vs Functional Programming

This assignment has two parts:

1. In [./Assignment/Part1.js], you will be given a handful of functions. Your job is determine if the function is a "pure" function or an "impure" function. Write your answer in the code comments.
2. In [./Assignment/Part2.js], you will be given a bunch of function implementations that use some kind of "for-loop" to acccomplish its task. Rewrite these functions using "map" instead.
