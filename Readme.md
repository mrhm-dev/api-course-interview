# Upwork Interview

Congratulations on being the selected for this next round ðŸŽ‰

The goal of this task is to guage how you will perform exactly the kinds of tasks you will be doing for this project. Your performance will be weighed with your original proposal when I make my final decision.

## What I am looking for

I have hired you for a set amount of hours to complete this task (see our Upwork conversation for the number of hours you ave to complete). Based on these hours, I am judging you based off of:

- The quality of your results in this task
- The efficiency at which you completed this task
- Your creativity and understanding of the core material.

Please work at a similar pace you would work on any project.

## Do I need to complete everything before submitting?

Absolutely not. In fact, I expect that many will not be able to complete everything listed out in this assignment - that's okay! I intentionally included a lot of instructions to try to determine how much you are able to do in the given timeframe (and what the quality of that work is like).

If you run out of time, please simply submit what you have (instructions for submission are given in a later section in this document). Half-finished work is better than no work at all! ðŸ˜€

## The Task

Let's begin!

TODO

## How to Submit

You will submit your interview assignment by making a PR to main using Git and Github. If you already know how to do this, great! If not I have given some instructions below:

First, you will need to create a branch in your name. E.g:

> git checkout -b Greg-Upwork-Interview

Then, commit all of your changes to the branch. Remember to use .gitignore for any changes that should not be committed (these include IDE setup files, third-party packages, etc.)

> git add .

> git commit -m "Submit assignment"

> git push -u origin Greg-Upwork-Interview

Then, in Github, navigate to this repo and click "Compare & pull request" to make a PR against the main branch.

Add a descriptive title in your PR and include the following in your description:

- A summary of what you were able to finish in this assignment.
- An estimate of how long you think it would take you to finish everything asked in this assignment.
- If there is anything I should know about your submission in particular (for example, maybe you submitted less than you otherwise would because you had trouble installing dependencies - I'd love to be able to take things like this into account when making a final decision).
- Any feedback you have for me on this assignment / interviewing process.

Lastly, please message me on Upwork when you have completed your assignment.

## Final Thoughts

Thank you for giving me your time to do this interview. I know this task may be a little outside of what you are used to doing on upwork, but remember that I wouldn't have chosen you for this round of interview if I didn't think you could rise to the challenge.

All submissions are due at 10:00 pm PDT on Friday May 7th. I will then use the weekend to review all submissions and make my final hiring decision by Monday May 10th.

Good luck!
